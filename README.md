# `teodorlu/bb-select-tui`

*Q: What's this?*

I wanted to create an FZF-based TUI selector for babashka script to avoid duplication.

*Q: What happened?*

I got distracted and did something else.

*Q: will this ever be made?*

Perhaps!
I'm going to archive this repo and continue in [teodorlu/shed][shed]
